### About

_A knight's tour is a chessboard move sequence where the knight visits every square exactly once. The tour is closed if the knight stops on a square that is one knight's move from the beginning square,¬†otherwise, it is open. The closed tour is implemented in this project using the Warnsdorff's rule. Where the knight is manipulated in such a way that it always goes to the nopde with the fewest onward moves. We exclude the nodes that return to a previously visited nodes when computing the number of onward moves for each candidate board square._
